## Getting started

If you have never used Backpack before, the best place to understand it and get started is [backpackforlaravel.com](https://backpackforlaravel.com/). 

## Install

Please note you need to install Backpack\Base before you can use Backpack\CRUD. It will provide you with the AdminLTE design.

Installation guides:
- [Install Backpack 4.0 on Laravel 6](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/4.0/installation) - recommended
- [Install Backpack 3.6 on Laravel 5.8 or 6.x](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/3.6/installation) - last feature update was 17th Sep 2019;
- [Install Backpack 3.5 on Laravel 5.5, 5.6, 5.7](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/3.5/installation) - last feature update was 27th Feb 2019;
- [Install Backpack 3.x on Laravel 5.4](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/docs/install-on-laravel-54) - last feature update was 27 Sep 2017;
- [Install Backpack 3.x on Laravel 5.3](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/docs/installation-on-laravel-53) - last feature update was 02 Feb 2017;

## Features

Check out [the about page in the documentation](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/4.0/getting-started-crud-operations) to get familiar with most Backpack features.


## Usage

If you've already checked out the features link above, take a look at how you can create a CRUD for a model in [this example](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/4.0/getting-started-crud-operations). At the end of the page you'll also find a way you can do everything in 1-2 minutes, using the command line and [backpack/generators](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/generators).

In short:

1. Make your model use the CrudTrait.

2. Create a controller that extends CrudController, route and menu item.

3. **(optional)** Define your validation rules in a Request files.

# Versioning

When installing Backpack, require its minor version (currently ```4.0.*```). Minor versions include minor breaking changes. This allows us to push new features without charging our users again. For us, this is what ```major.minor.patch``` means:

- ```major``` - **PAID upgrade; MAJOR breaking changes;** historically every 2-3 years; upgrading may take even 2-3 hours; includes major new features, major changes in how the whole system works, and complete rewrites; it allows us to _considerably_ improve the product, and add features that were previously impossible;
- ```minor``` - **FREE upgrade; MINOR breaking changes**; historically every 6-12 months; upgrading takes less than 30 minutes; it allows us to add big new features, for free;
- ```patch``` - **FREE upgrade; NO breaking changes**; historically every week; upgrading can be done automatically with composer; includes bug fixes and non-breaking new features;
